Using the files in the folder, we can upload cyberattack data downloaded from logstash to an Elasticsearch server.

Notes:
If you already have an ES server set up and data is already being stored in it, this step is unecessary. 

Before storing data into the ES server, you need to start a server first(the steps are as follows):
- download elastic search from the website with your according os
- follow the instructions on the official website to start the server 
- *I had some troubles starting the server and I fixed it by going to the elasticsearch folder --> config --> elasticsearch.yml and setting xpack.security.http.ssl: enabled: and xpack.security.enabled: to be false. 


Two files in this folder:
store_ES - this python file takes the cyberattack data from the json file (Search_query.json) and stores it into the elasticsearch server 
Search_quety.json - the data
