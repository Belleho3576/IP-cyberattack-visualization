# IP-cyberattack-visualization

**Disclaimer**

Most of the code of this project is taken from https://github.com/MatthewClarkMay/geoip-attack-map which is made by MatthewClarkMay 

What I have changed are some debugged codes due to upgrades and expired websites and using my own data set that is stored in an elasticsearch server rather than generating dummy traffic. 

### Ubuntu 
This project is tested on LTS Ubuntu 20.04 which uses python 3.8.

### Configurations
- Use you own Mapbox API access token which can be generated for free to maintain the map - can change that in the map.js file in AttackMapServer --> static --> map.js
- Change root access to the gen_data python file if you wish to replace it with another of your own 
- Remember, this code will only run correctly in a production environment after personalizing the parsing functions. The default parsing function is only written to parse gen_data.py traffic.**
